                <p>COSTA MESA, Calif.— Vocal Point, the award-winning male a capella group from Brigham Young University has produced a new music video set for release on May 5, 2015. The video features a new and moving arrangement of “Homeward Bound,” and was filmed and recorded on March 28th, the day after the group’s sold-out concert in Newport Beach in collaboration with The All-American Boys Chorus. The Oak Canyon Nature Center in Anaheim served as the locale.</p>
                <p>Vocal Point and The All-American Boys Chorus first met 3 years ago when the world-renowned Boys Chorus traversed Utah on their Rocky Mountain concert tour and met with members of Vocal Point to explore the popular world of contemporary a cappella singing. Preview audiences have remarked on the video’s powerful and universally positive message, leading to its release in the week prior to Mother’s Day.</p>
                <p>Vocal Point received two CARA Awards for the best Contemporary a cappella album of 2014, and was a nationally featured finalist on NBC’s “The Sing-Off.” The All-American Boys Chorus is a professional ensemble based in Costa Mesa. In addition to collaborating with Vocal Point, the Chorus also just recorded the definitive “A Charlie Brown Christmas” album with Grammy nominated pianist David Benoit for release this coming holiday season. Later this year the Chorus will perform at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. as well as embark on a concert tour throughout Japan.</p>

                <p>(COSTA MESA, Calif.) – April 9, 2015 – The internationally acclaimed All American Boys
Chorus invites boys 8, 9 and 10 years old to be “AABC Shadows” and experience what it’s like to be an AABC chorister on Saturday, April 25th and will take place at AABC Headquarters at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa.“The All American Boys Chorus wants to reach out to as many families as possible,” Anthony Manrique, executive director of the AABC, said. “Boys in the AABC receive a superbmusic education, acquire leadership qualities, establish lifelong friendships, and enjoy unique opportunities to travel the world.”</p>
                <p>Artistic Director Wesley Martin states that “Shadow Day is a perfect showcase for interested boys and parents to see our choristers in action. This short visit might be the beginning of a wonderful journey that sees boys walk away from the AABC in a few years as fine young men, inspired with vision and determination and leadership instilled through a program of musical excellence.” AABC staff members and parents will be on hand on Shadow Day to answer questions and provide information.</p>
                <p>To date, the AABC has released five albums and performed to standing ovations in concerts worldwide. The Chorus’s 2014 concert tour included performances in Washington State, and in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta. Summer of 2013 found the Chorus touring in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
                <p>The AABC’s choristers have sung before some of the nation’s most prestigious audiences—from U.S. presidents to well-known celebrities, including Josh Groban, John Williams, David Benoit, Tony Bennett, Taylor Hicks, Paul Anka, Bob Hope, and Victor Borge. There have also been artistic collaborations with Disney, the Pacific Symphony, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Pacific Chorale. Additionally, the AABC has given its youngsters a taste of stardom; earning them television credits for nationwide commercials for Mazda, Toshiba, Cartoon Network, KFC and Pacific Life.</p>
                <p>Celebrating its 45th in community involvement, and has performed for more than 50,000 school children in Southern California and on 50+ concert tours. For more information on the All-American Boys Chorus, call (714) 708-1670 or visit www.taabc.org. anniversary in 2015, the All-American Boys Chorus believes strongly</p>
